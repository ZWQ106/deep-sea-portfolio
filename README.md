> **"Giving intelligence a physical form."**

Welcome to my digital portfolio. This project is a conceptual deep-dive into my work in **Computer Engineering**, **Robotics**, and **Embodied AI**, visualized through an immersive web experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
* **3D Engine**: [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) (R3F)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS & Framer Motion
* **Deployment**: Vercel

## 🌟 Highlights

* **Immersive Ocean Environment**: Custom shaders for sunbeams, water depth, and caustic effects.
* **Autonomous Agents**: 3D fish models with independent swimming logic ("SmartFish" components).
* **Performance Optimized**: Heavy use of instancing for bubbles and efficient GLTF loading.
